# Features
Users input activities, weather, and dates into our application and we then recommend countries we think they should visit

The user selects the days they would like to travel to help determine the average tempeature of that country during that time 

Utilizes a costum scoring algorhtim we created to suggest the best country that matches their selections

# Future Goals

In the future we hope to implement features that suggest flights to the user as well as the ability to put a score value associtated to the languages spoken in the country
